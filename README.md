# ðŸª¶ Totem  

**Totem** is a total, decompressive, typed language.  
Every UTF-8 string is a valid Totem program â€” there are no syntax errors, ever.

Instead of parsing text, Totem **inflates** information.  
The compiler acts as a **semantic decompressor**, mapping raw bytes into a fully typed, scope-aware, and lifetime-safe computation graph.

Totem unifies **type theory**, **information theory**, and **systems safety** into a single algebraic model:

```
TOTEM := (Î£*, D, âŠ—, T, E)

where
  Î£* = UTF-8 program space
  D  = total decompressor â†’ typed AST graph
  âŠ—  = monoidal composition operator
  T  = type / lifetime / effect lattice
  E  = total evaluator
```

## Why Totem?

| Principle | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| **Totality** | Every UTF-8 input inflates into a well-typed program. No syntax errors, no undefined behavior. |
| **Arity Algebra** | Function signatures and types emerge automatically from argument structure (arity). |
| **Scoped Geometry** | `{}` and `()` build real lexical and evaluation scopes; ownership and lifetimes follow geometry. |
| **Purity Gradient** | Effects are modeled as a graded monad (`pure âŠ‚ state âŠ‚ io âŠ‚ sys âŠ‚ meta`). |
| **Safe by Construction** | Lifetimes and borrows are inferred automatically; aliasing and use-after-free are impossible. |
| **Decompressive Compilation** | The compiler expands compressed meaning into structured, typed computation. |
| **Continuous Semantics** | Similar bytes produce similar programs â€” enabling mutation, learning, and program synthesis. |

## Example

```totem
{a{bc}de{fg}}
```

Inflates to a nested scope graph:

```
Scope(root)
  Scope(scope_0)
    A:int32
    Scope(scope_1)
      B:int32  â†’ shared borrow of A
      C:int32  â†’ mut borrow of B
      drops [B, C]
    D:int32  â†’ shared borrow of A
    E:int32  â†’ mut borrow of D
    Scope(scope_2)
      F:int32  â†’ shared borrow of E
      G:int32  â†’ mut borrow of F
      drops [F, G]
    drops [A, D, E]
```

Compile-time checks guarantee:
- All borrows are valid.
- No mutable + shared aliasing.
- No borrow outlives its owner.
- All values are dropped safely at end of scope.

## Architecture

```
UTF-8 bytes
    â†“
[ Decompressor ]
    â†’ builds scopes `{}` `()`
    â†’ infers operator arity and types
    â†“
[ Type & Lifetime Graph ]
    â†’ computes ownership, borrows, drops
    â†“
[ Purity / Effect Analysis ]
    â†’ isolates impure nodes in effect scopes
    â†“
[ Evaluator / Backend ]
    â†’ executes total graph deterministically
```

Every stage is **total** â€” no parsing errors, no undefined states.

## Philosophy

> Programming is compression.  
> Compilation is decompression.  
> Safety is geometry.

Totem treats computation as **information un-folding**:  
code is not written, it is *unpacked* from data.  
Every byte belongs, every operation finds its lawful place in the algebra.

## Current Status

- âœ… Structural decompressor â†’ builds scopes and typed nodes  
- âœ… Lifetime & borrow inference  
- âœ… Compile-time safety analysis  
- ðŸ”œ Purity / effect monad layer  
- ðŸ”œ Typed IR and interpreter  
- ðŸ”œ Rust / MLIR backend  
- ðŸ”œ Visualizer for scopes, lifetimes, and effects

## Roadmap

1. **Purity-aware evaluation** â€” execute total graphs with effect isolation.  
2. **Typed IR (TIR)** â€” a linear SSA form for Totem graphs.  
3. **Backend targets** â€” generate Rust or LLVM IR.  
4. **Visualizer** â€” inspect the decompressed program graph in real time.  
5. **Continuous semantics** â€” experiment with evolutionary and neural programming over Totem space.

**Totem** is an original research language concept by Sean Evans.  
It blends ideas from Rust, type theory, category theory, and information geometry  
to explore a world where *no program is ever invalid*.
